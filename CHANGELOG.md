# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Panels+** KOReader plugin are documented in this file. From version v1.2.0

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- "Open panels with" setting: a long press, as before, or a two-finger tap. With two-finger tap, a long press is left to KOReader and other plugins (for example Bubble Zoom).
- **Auto-rotate double-page spreads**
  - New setting `Auto-rotate double-page spreads` with `Off` (default), `Clockwise` and `Counter-clockwise`. It is in `More Panel Viewer Settings` under `[Rotation]` and in the plugin's main menu. A page counts as a spread when its native width/height ratio is at least `spread_min_ratio` (1.2).
  - Reading page: the screen is rotated when a page turn lands on a spread and restored on the next normal page. The rotation happens before the page is painted, so it costs one refresh. A screen the user rotated to landscape is left alone, and a spread the user rotates back by hand is skipped. The temporary rotation is not written to the book's saved rotation.
  - Panel viewer: the whole-spread view is rotated as an image, in the same direction as the reading page. Panels inside a spread stay upright. An angle set in the rotation picker still applies to every panel and takes priority. The picker's "no rotation" does not disable the setting, because the picker cannot reset to "never chosen" and that value stays saved after any hand rotation is undone.
  - Rotated views are rendered at the size of the rotated screen. Before, a quarter-turned view was rendered for the upright screen (1272 px wide on a 1272x1696 screen) and scaled up by a third after rotation. This also covers views rotated from the picker when their viewer opens, the "No crop" canvas and the next-panel prerender.
  - Smooth navigation falls back to an instant cut when the panel it leaves or lands on is rotated. The pan is computed for an upright bitmap, so on a rotated one it moved the wrong way and the zoom jumped at the end.

### Fixed

- **Touch-and-hold hits the right word in a view rotated by a quarter turn**
  - `PanelViewer:screenToPageTransform` and `pageToScreenTransform` had the 90 and 270 cases swapped relative to the angle `ImageWidget` draws (`rotation_angle` turns the bitmap counter-clockwise). In a view rotated from the rotation picker or by KOReader's "auto-rotate for best fit", a press mapped to the diagonally opposite point of the page, and the lookup underline was drawn there. The round-trip spec passed because both functions were wrong in the same way. New specs check the mapping against the position of the page's corner in the drawn bitmap. For KOReader's boolean auto-rotation the angle is now read from the widget.

- **Swiping down for Kobo-style zoom on the left edge no longer exits the panel viewer**
  - The left-edge swipe-down gesture doubled as both "zoom out" (when already zoomed in) and "close the viewer" (at standard zoom), because both paths shared the same gesture zone. That meant a swipe meant purely for one-handed zoom control could unexpectedly kick the reader out of the panel viewer entirely. It now always zooms out, at any zoom level, and never closes the viewer -- closing stays on the existing "Close" button and tap-outside-frame gesture.

- **Panel viewer now respects night mode**
  - `ImageViewer` (the base widget `PanelViewer` builds on) paints panel crops, letterbox padding, title bar, progress bar, and button table with hardcoded light colours and has no night-mode awareness anywhere in its own code -- unlike the normal page-turn path (`KoptInterface:drawPage`), which checks `Screen.night_mode` and inverts. A first pass inverted colour at each render call site (`Document:drawPagePart()` results, composited transition canvases), but that only covered the plain single-panel view -- the bottom options bar and any letterboxed/size-mismatched swipe or pan transition frame stayed light, since they're painted by code with no hook into any of those call sites. `PanelViewer:paintTo` now inverts the whole `main_frame` region once, after `ImageViewer` finishes painting it -- the one point guaranteed to see every pixel actually drawn, regardless of which internal path produced it.

- **Word lookup: the underline no longer lands off the word it looked up**
  - `ReaderHighlight:onHold` stores a *reference* to the selection's `sboxes` table in `view.highlight.temp[page]`, and `PanelViewer:paintHighlights` draws from `temp` in preference to the selection itself. `_refineWordSelection` replaced `selected_text.sboxes` with a new table, so the underline kept being painted from KOReader's *original* box while OCR and the dictionary used the refined one. KOReader's box takes its `y`/`h` from the whole **text line**, not the word (`KoptInterface:getWordFromBoxes` reads them off the line box) -- which is exactly why the mismatch showed up as a vertical offset. Refinement now re-points `temp` at the refined box too.

- **Word lookup: no longer invents a word when the crop wasn't readable**
  - **Unbounded ink runs are rejected instead of OCRed.** When the tapped line's rows are covered edge to edge by something the ink test can't distinguish from lettering (screentone, a solid bubble border, a black gutter), no gap ever reaches the word-boundary threshold and the horizontal hunt just ran to both edges of the render crop. That crop-wide box was handed to Tesseract, which dutifully transcribed the noise into a plausible-looking word. A run that reaches the crop edge *still on ink* -- or a box wider than 14x its line height -- now falls back to KOReader's own selection.
  - **OCR results are validated before they replace the selection.** Tesseract given an unreadable crop returns punctuation soup (`|_-`, `»«`), not an error. A result now has to look like a word (at least one letter, no more junk than letters, a single token) before it overwrites the document's own text. Non-ASCII letters are decoded properly, so accented Latin and CJK results are not mistaken for junk -- Lua's `%a` class is ASCII-only.
  - **Unreadable tight crops get one retry with a padded box.** The tight box is what makes OCR resolution usable at all (`getNativeOCRWord` scales the box so its *height* renders at 30px), but it can clip an anti-aliased stem or an accent, and Tesseract reads a beheaded glyph as a different letter or drops it. The retry only runs on the failure path.
  - **OCR output is normalized.** `getTOCRWord` returns its transcription with a trailing newline; `ReaderDictionary` trims before looking a word up, but Copy, Add note, Wikipedia and the saved annotation text all took `selected_text.text` verbatim.

- **Word lookup: word boxes no longer clip glyphs or snap to the wrong line**
  - **Ascenders and descenders outside the tap band are kept.** The line's vertical extent is measured over a fixed ±30px band around the tap, which is narrower than most words, so a tall letter at the far end of the same word was invisible to that measurement and the box cropped straight through it. The box's vertical extent is now re-derived from the word's *own* columns once its horizontal bounds are known.
  - **Snapping onto ink is bounded.** A tap that landed on background snapped to the nearest ink *anywhere* in the render crop -- up to 15% of a page away -- so a tap in a bubble's margin could silently resolve to a word in a different bubble. Snapping is now limited to one line height vertically and two horizontally; past that the tap falls back to KOReader.
  - **Inter-letter gap calibration is windowed to the tapped line.** Gaps were collected across the whole render crop, so ink runs out in the panel art contributed "gaps" that skewed the median the word-boundary threshold is derived from.
  - **Tile coordinates are anchored to the renderer's own origin.** `Geom:transformByScale` *floors* the scaled crop origin and `Document:renderPage` draws the page offset by that floored value; deriving tile coordinates from the unrounded crop origin left the reported box shifted from the pixels actually measured.

- **Word lookup diagnostics no longer run in normal use**
  - Two PGM crop dumps (~120 KB each, written to both the working directory and `/tmp`), a log append to two files, and an on-screen `[WordFinder]` toast fired on *every* long-press regardless of settings. All four are now gated behind the existing **debug mode** toggle.

### Added

- **Nav. Animated mode**
  - Cycles alongside Classic and Smooth and uses KOReader's framebuffer transition between panels and page boundaries.
  - Long-pressing the mode opens independent **Animate between panels** and **Animate between pages** toggles, both enabled by default.

- **KEPUB embedded-image compatibility**
  - Panels+ now explicitly accepts direct `.kepub` files in the same rolling-reader embedded-image path as EPUB and MOBI. Kobo-synced `.kepub.epub` books remain supported through their EPUB suffix, and a regression test covers both Kobo naming conventions.

- **Comic-Lettering-Aware Word Finder & OCR Segmentation**
  - **Local Line Height & Gap Thresholding**: Scoped vertical line extent detection (`row_ink`) to a local horizontal column band (~60px around tap point) in `src/_wordfinder.lua`. Prevents multi-word lines (e.g., "what's for dinner?") from merging into giant multi-line blocks that break Tesseract OCR.
  - **Tight Box Bounds**: Reduced internal padding (`PAD_RATIO` -> `0.02`) so KOReader's native `getNativeOCRWord` 30% expansion produces clean, tight crops without bleeding into neighboring words (fixing "uh?" -> "are" and "not" -> "o").
  - **Robust Background & Polarity Estimation**: Used 75th percentile crop luminance to accurately identify paper background vs text ink for both standard and inverted (white-on-dark) comic text.

- **Diagnostic Logging & On-Screen Visual Toasts**
  - **Programmatic Log File (`/tmp/panels_wordfinder.log`)**: Appends tap coordinates, background/polarity, line height, calibrated gap threshold, resulting box dimensions, final OCR text, and text-art column ink maps (e.g. `|###..#####..###|`) for easy copy/pasting and troubleshooting.
  - **KOReader Logger Integration**: Tagged entries with `[Panels+ WordFinder]` in KOReader `logger.info` output.
  - **On-Screen Notification Toast**: Displays transient `[WordFinder] 'recognized_word' (120x35)` toast on text selection for instant visual confirmation.

- **Tesseract OCR Memory Leak Prevention**
  - **Cleanup & Purging**: Added `WordFinder.cleanup()` and integrated it into `PanelViewer:onClose` and document teardown. Explicitly evicts cached `OCREngine` objects from `DocCache` and calls `freeOCR()`, releasing all Tesseract DAWGs (`eng.traineddatapunc-dawg`, `eng.traineddataword-dawg`, etc.) and eliminating C++ `ObjectCache` leak warnings on KOReader shutdown.

- **Comic-Mode Panel Border Detection (bleed layouts, dark/colored panels)**
  - **Problem**: the fast segmenter only ever looked for blank (background-coloured) gutters between panels. Western comics routinely bleed differently-coloured, dark, or grey panels edge to edge with no blank gutter at all -- only the artist's drawn black border stroke -- which the old search had nothing to find and either mis-split or gave up on, falling back to the native detector that explicitly can't handle dark backgrounds either. Verified against a dark, multi-colour CBR (Deadpool) with heavy bleed panels.
  - **Border-stroke ink map**: `src/_pagebitmap.lua` now builds a second, absolute-luminance flag array (`map.border`) alongside the existing background-relative ink map, marking near-black cells regardless of the page's own background colour. Built only when `mode == "comic"`; manga pages never pay for it.
  - **Border-line separator search**: `src/_segmenter.lua` adds `findBorderLine`/`projectWithBorder`, tried after the existing blank-gutter search and before the slanted-gutter ladder. It looks for a thin (bounded-width), densely dark run spanning a region's full cross-section -- a drawn panel border -- as opposed to a wide dark run, which is treated as a filled panel interior and left alone.
  - **New settings**: `segment_border_luminance_max` (60), `segment_border_line_ratio` (0.97), `segment_border_width_ratio` (0.01), all comic-mode only.
  - **Fixed false splits found in on-device testing**: a tall, roughly centered character silhouette on a grey background could mimic a drawn vertical rule closely enough to trigger a false split, and a thin page-footer rule near the page edge could get carved off as its own tiny "panel". Tightened `segment_border_line_ratio` (0.85 -> 0.97, a drawn rule is essentially 100% solid; an organic silhouette rarely is) and `segment_border_width_ratio` (0.02 -> 0.01), and `findBorderLine` now rejects any candidate line whose split would leave either side smaller than `min_side` -- the same floor `emitLeaf` already enforces on real panels, applied before the split happens instead of after.
  - **Deep mode ("exact" detector) no longer silently defeats comic mode**: it only recognizes white gutters and gives up on dark backgrounds, which comic pages routinely have. Switching to comic mode now forces the detector back to "auto" if Deep mode was active, and the "Deep mode" menu option is greyed out while comic mode is on.

- **Touch & Hold Text Selection & Dictionary Lookups in Zoom Mode**
  - **Screen-to-Page Coordinate Transformation**: Converted touch points on zoomed panel images (`_image_wg` blitbuffer viewport and pan offsets) to native document page coordinates `{x, y, page}`.
  - **Hold Gesture Delegation**: Added handlers for `onHold`, `onHoldPan`, `onHoldRelease`, and `onHoldPanRelease` in `PanelViewer` to delegate word selection and dictionary lookups to KOReader's `ReaderHighlight` module (`lookupDictWord`).
  - **Real-Time Text Selection Highlight Overlay**: Added `pageToScreenTransform(box)` and `paintHighlights(bb)` to render selection highlight boxes (`sboxes`/`pboxes`) directly on top of zoomed panel images in real-time.
  - **Settings & Menu Toggle**: Added `hold_text_selection` setting default and menu toggle under plugin settings (`"Touch & hold text selection in zoom"`).
  - **Works across CBZ, CBR, and PDF**: word/text boxes come from the document's own embedded OCR text layer on PDF, or from KOReader's on-the-fly OCR fallback on CBZ/CBR (which carry no text layer at all) -- the highlight/lookup path is shared, format-agnostic code.
  - **Fixed "big black square" highlight**: coarse or oversized word/line boxes (common with OCR on comic/manga art) no longer get filled solid with the "invert" drawer. `paintHighlights` now flags a box whose page-space area covers ≥60% of the current panel crop as anomalous and draws a thin outline instead of a full fill, so a bad box still gives visual feedback without obscuring the panel art.

- **Left-Edge Vertical Swipe Gestures (One-Handed, Kobo-Style Zoom)**
  - **Swipe UP on the left edge** (left 25% of screen): Zooms in on the current panel image to easily inspect small text or fine details without needing multi-finger pinch gestures.
  - **Swipe DOWN on the left edge**: Zooms back out towards standard panel zoom level, whether already zoomed in or not.
  - General image panning across the rest of the screen remains fully preserved when zoomed in.

- **"More config..." button in the panel viewer's control bar**
  - Sits to the left of the panel-detection cycle button and opens a small options menu, the same kind the "Nav. Smooth" button's long-press already used, for settings that don't need a dedicated button of their own.
  - **Tap screen sides to navigate**: tap the left or right edge of the screen to move to the previous/next panel instead of only toggling the controls. Which side advances depends on reading mode: right side in Comic mode, left side in Manga mode -- independent of "Invert panel swipe direction", which only affects swiping. Off by default; only active at standard zoom, so it never steals taps from zoomed-in panning.
  - **Swipe to navigate**: lets swipe-based panel navigation be turned off, e.g. for readers who only want tap/button/physical-key navigation and find accidental swipes annoying. On by default, preserving existing behavior.

- **Physical Buttons & Bluetooth Page Turner Integration**
  - **Boundary Page Crossing**: Advancing past the last panel of a page via physical side buttons (e.g., Kobo Libra Colour) or Bluetooth remotes now automatically turns the document page and opens panel 1 of the next page. Pressing back from panel 1 similarly crosses into the previous page.
  - **`GotoViewRel` Handler**: Added `PanelViewer:onGotoViewRel(diff)`, KOReader's standard relative page-turn event, so any input source that turns pages the normal KOReader way (hardware keys, the dispatcher's "Turn pages" action, `autoturn.koplugin`) drives panel-by-panel navigation instead of silently turning the underlying document page behind the panel viewer.
  - **Full Compatibility with `kobo.koplugin`**: Bluetooth controllers bound through `kobo.koplugin`'s essential actions (which fire `GotoViewRel`) are now supported out-of-the-box with zero extra configuration.

- **Developer & Testing Launcher Scripts**
  - Added `rungeneric.sh`: Easily launches KOReader Flatpak in standard desktop mode.
  - Added `runkobo.sh`: Launches KOReader Flatpak pre-configured with Kobo reader characteristics (632x840 resolution, 300 DPI, and e-ink grayscale rendering) for easy local testing.

### Fixed

- **Comic mode split single panels in two**
  - **Cause**: the drawn-border search keys on a thin, full-span, densely dark run. That is what a stroke shared between two edge-to-edge panels looks like -- and also exactly what a horizon, a caption rule, a letterbox band or a pole drawn *inside* one panel looks like. In the ink map the two are byte-identical, so no threshold separates them, and every page carrying such a line had a real panel cut in half.
  - **Fix**: the search is now opt-in via `segment_border_split` (default off) and a new **Panels+ → Panel detection → "Split on drawn panel borders (experimental)"** toggle, enabled only in comic mode. Off, those pages read correctly and genuinely bled layouts fall back to the already-documented "panels with no gutter" limitation -- one panel instead of two, which costs far less than half a panel. `src/_pagebitmap.lua` also skips building the border plane entirely when it is off, dropping a per-cell comparison and a full `w*h` allocation from every comic page.
  - The panel cache is keyed on the toggle, so flipping it re-detects rather than serving stale panels, and flipping back is instant.

- **Tiny "panels" containing no artwork** (both modes)
  - **Cause**: `emitLeaf` only had shape floors. A scanlation credit strip clears them comfortably -- at 182x20 on a 480x720 map it is 3640 cells against a 1728-cell area floor, and both sides beat the 14-cell side floor -- so it was emitted as a panel the reader then had to swipe through.
  - **Fix**: a leaf is now rejected when it is *both* elongated past `segment_sliver_aspect` (default `4`) **and** holds less than `segment_sliver_ink` (default `0.02`) of the page's total ink. The conjunction matters: measured on a typical page a credit strip is 0.96% of the page's ink at 9.1:1, but a legitimate 60x60 inset panel is only 1.51% and a 458x60 letterbox panel is 7.6:1 -- so an ink floor alone would drop the inset before the strip, and an aspect limit alone would drop both real panels. Only "stretched out **and** nearly empty" describes furniture and nothing else.
  - The ink floor is a share of the page rather than an absolute count, so a near-blank page with one small drawing still keeps it.

- **Test coverage**: added `tests/spec/segmenter_spec.lua`, driving the real `Segmenter.segment()` over synthetic maps built at the 480x720 size `_pagebitmap` actually produces, so the cut's fraction-of-map floors are exercised at the values real pages hit. Pins the grid and splash baselines, both fixes above, and the drawn-border ambiguity in both toggle states.
