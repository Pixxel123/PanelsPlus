--- KOReader's night mode is a single global invert applied to the whole
--- framebuffer at flush time (`Screen:toggleNightMode()`), not something
--- each widget opts into -- that's why plain chrome (button table, frame
--- background, progress bar) needs no dark-mode-aware colors of its own to
--- look right: it gets inverted for free along with everything else on
--- screen. `ImageWidget` defaults `original_in_nightmode = true` specifically
--- to *cancel* that global invert for actual image content, so a manga scan
--- keeps its real colors instead of rendering as a photo negative.
---
--- This used to invert `main_frame.dimen` here manually, on the belief that
--- ImageViewer's chrome had no night-mode awareness at all. It does, via the
--- mechanism above -- and the manual invert stacked with the global one,
--- cancelling out for every pixel it covered. That left the button table and
--- any letterboxed/margin background stuck showing their original light
--- colors while the rest of the screen went dark.
---
--- But for comic/manga pages specifically, "keep the original colors" is the
--- wrong call: these are line art on a bright white background, not photos,
--- so leaving `ImageWidget`'s cancel-invert in place makes the panel a
--- blinding white rectangle in an otherwise dark screen. We want the panel
--- itself to go dark too. Inverting just `self._image_wg.dimen` (populated
--- by `ImageWidget:paintTo` during the call above) cancels ImageWidget's own
--- cancel-invert -- one more invert on top of two is net-inverted -- without
--- touching the chrome around it, which stays correctly dark from the single
--- global invert alone.

--- centered position on this canvas is pixel-identical to what the trailing
--- `switchToImageNum()` handoff will show, and the swap goes unnoticed. The
--- canvas is symmetric around that center by construction (equal half-extents
--- on every side), sized to whichever is larger: the half-screen (so `target`'s
--- own letterboxing, if any, matches its normal render) or the actual distance to
--- `rect_a`'s farthest edge (so the pan has real ground to cross). Real page
--- pixels (the union of both panels) are pasted into this canvas at their true
--- position; anything else -- including space beyond the actual page edges, when
--- centering `target` requires it -- is left blank, exactly like the blank
--- letterbox margins a normal single-panel view already shows. Falls back to an
--- instant swap on any failure, a missing rect pair, or when the canvas would be

--- Rotate the whole device/screen via KOReader's own rotation, exactly like

--- items, which broadcast this same event for the same reason: several
--- modules (e.g. `ReaderView:onSetRotationMode`) listen for it to update
--- their own layout alongside the screen itself.
---
--- Base `ImageViewer` has no `onScreenResize`/`onSetDimensions` handler of
--- its own (it's built for short-lived overlays, not ones that outlive a
--- screen rotation): its outer region gets sized once at construction from
--- `Screen:getWidth/getHeight()` and never revisited, so simply leaving it
--- open across a rotation leaves stale strips uncovered by the reader's own
--- full repaint. `device_rotate_callback` (wired up by `ViewerController`)
--- closes this viewer, performs the rotation, and reopens an equivalent one
--- for the same page/panel/index -- the same close-and-rebuild idiom
--- `setViewerBleedRatio` already uses for a crop-rectangle change -- so the
--- reader stays in zoom mode instead of dropping back to the plain page
--- view. Without a controller wired up (e.g. standalone use), falls back to
--- closing outright: `UIManager:onRotation()` (setDirty "all"/"full" +
--- forceRePaint) is the same belt-and-suspenders flash every built-in
--- rotation control in KOReader chains after broadcasting the event.
---
--- Each direction is a *relative* turn from wherever the screen currently
--- is, not a fixed absolute target -- pressing "right" while already
--- rotated clockwise turns another quarter further, like holding a D-pad,
--- rather than jumping back to a fixed clockwise orientation. KOReader's
--- rotation-mode integers are themselves sequential quarter-turn steps
